$\begin{array}{|l|cccccccc|}\hline \text{Age of Husband (Years)}& 23& 27& 28& 29& 30& 31& 33& 35& 36& 39\\\hline \text{Age of Wife (Years)   }& 18& 22& 23& 24& 25& 26& 28& 29& 30& 32\\\hline \end{array}$

## R code

```{r}
# loading data

##  Question-7

A die was thrown 9000 times and of these 3220 yielded a 3 or 4.Can the die be regarded as unbiased?

## R-code

```{r}
prop.test(x=3220,n=9000,p=1/3,alternative = 'two.sided')
```

## Result and discussion

Here the p value is 9.193e-07 which is greater than 5% significant level. Null hypothesis is rejected. So it is statistically reasonable to conclude that the die which was thrown 9000 times and of these 3220 yielded a 3 or 4 cannot be regarded as unbiased.

## Question-8

In a random sample of 400 persons from a large population, 120 are females. Can it be said that males and females are in the ratio 5:3 in the population? Use 1% significance?

## R-code

```{r}
prop.test(x=120,n=400,p=3/8,alternative = 'two.sided')
```

## Results and Discussions

Since the p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected at 5 percent significance level. So it is reasonable to conclude that the ratio of male to female is 5:3.

## Question-9

The adjoining table shows the number of motor registrations in a certain territory for a 230 term of 5 years and the sale of motor tyre by a firm in that territory for the same period.

+----------------+----------------+------------------------+
| Year           | Motor          | No of Sales            |
|                | Registration   |                        |
| 1              |                | 1250                   |
|                | 600            |                        |
+----------------+----------------+------------------------+
| 2              | 630            | 1100                   |
+----------------+----------------+------------------------+
| 3              | 720            | 1300                   |
+----------------+----------------+------------------------+
| 4              | 750            | 1350                   |
+----------------+----------------+------------------------+
| 5              | 800            | 1500                   |

Find the regression equation to estimate the sale of Tyres when motor registration is known. Estimate 233 sale of Tyre when registration is 850.

## R-code

```{r}
marketing=data.frame(X=c(600,630,720,750,800),Y=c(1250,1100,1300,1350,1500))
cor.test(marketing$X,marketing$Y)
```
```{r}
model <- lm(Y ~ X , data = marketing)
summary(model)$coef

```

## Results and Discussions

From the given data, an OLS model is created using R function lm(). In our example, the fitted linear model is:
Sale of Tyre = 255.035971 + 1.492806(Motor registration), it can be seen that p-value of the F-statistic is 0.06567.

## Question-10

In a big city 325 men out of 600 men were found to be smokers. Does this information support the conclusion that the majority of men in this city are smokers? Justify your answer statistically.

## R-code

```{r}
prop.test(x=325,n=600,p=1/2,alternative = 'greater')

```

## Results and Discussions

Since the p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected at 5 percent significance level. So it is reasonable to conclude that the ratio of smokers to non smokers is greater than 50%.

## Question-11

The mean height of 500 male students who showed above average participation in college athletics was 75.2 inches with a standard deviation of 2.3 inches; while 500 male students who showed no interest in such participation had mean height of 68.5 inches with a standard deviation 2.9 inches. Test the hypothesis that male students who participate in college athletics are taller than other male students.

## R-code

```{r}
library(BSDA)
```
```{r}
zsum.test(mean.x = 75.2,n.x = 500,sigma.x = 75.2,
mean.y = 68.5,n.y = 500,sigma.y = 2.9,alternative = 'greater')
```
## Results and Discussions

Since the p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected at 5 percent significance level. So it is reasonable to conclude that the mean height of male students shows above average participation are significantly taller.
